# R code in a Jupyter notebook to test static figures and tables

The notebook `AMGtest.ipynb` contains my testing scripts used prior to including code in the `../flexdashboard/SI-29_dashboard.Rmd` dashboard.

I recognize that most R users don't typically use Jupyter... but I do :)  In order to run this, you will need to have Jupyter installed within your `conda` environment (or in whatever environment you use to run the R code).  Please see the `README.md` file from the root directory of this repo for more information on the libraries that must be installed, and the `../data/` directory that must be created, to run these codes.
